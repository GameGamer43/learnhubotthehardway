[Learn Hubot the Hard Way][book] is a short book written to help new and existing users install, configure and even contribute back to hubot and hubot-scripts. You'll also learn how the internals work in hubot itself.

Before reading this book you should be able to use and navigate a UNIX system, and use tools such as git and rubygems. The later chapters will require you to have an understanding of [Node.js][node] and [CoffeeScript][coffeescript].
